Hi, I am Mriganka! I am a 3rd year Doctoral Candidate at the **Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley**, supervised by [Shirshendu Ganguly](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sganguly/). I am broadly interested in various topics in modern probability, including spin systems, spectra of matrices, random graphs, Gibbs measures, and mixing times. You may find my academic resume [here](assets/docs/Mriganka_AcademicCV.pdf) and my industrial resume [here](assets/docs/Mriganka_IndustrialCV.pdf) (they are slightly different in emphasis and conciseness).
