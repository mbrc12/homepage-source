Apart from research, I spend a significant amount of time coding, making simulations (often probabilistic in nature!) and (simple/incomplete) games. Although I am no longer active in the scene, I used to participate quite frequently in competitive programming competitions, for example on Codeforces ([mbrc](https://codeforces.com/profile/mbrc)) and Codechef ([mbrc](https://www.codechef.com/users/mbrc)). Once a year, I would also participate in the now-defunct but celebrated [Google Code Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam). 

These more "scientific" pursuits aside, I also enjoy gaming, listening to music, reading manga and watching anime/TV shows. My two most favorite games are [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild/) (haven't had the chance to play Tears of the Kingdom yet!) and the [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) [The House in Fata Morgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Fata_Morgana). I am currently playing [Octopath Traveler II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II) (unfortunately without having played the first one).


 <!-- (mostly indoor though!). My favorite game (right now) is [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild/) with the visual novel, [The House in Fata Morgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Fata_Morgana) in second place. I am currently playing [Octopath Traveler II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II) (although I haven't played I).

I used to be an avid listener of progressive rock, mostly Porcupine Tree and Genesis. More recently, I have been enjoying [JYOCHO](https://jyocho.com/biography) and [mol-74](https://mol-74.jp/). At this point, I probably also remember the entire first Disc of [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)). In the past few days though, I have discovered some great video game music, of which [Kaine/Salvation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP4duz43t_A) takes the cake (but I haven't played the game yet!).

My favorite anime is [Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(manga)) by Naoki Urasawa with [_Haikyu!!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!) by Haruichi Furudate as a close second (those are links to the manga articles though). Among manga, I absolutely love Kaoru Mori's [Otoyomegatari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bride%27s_Story) and Natsu HyÅ«ga's [Kusuriya no Hitorigoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apothecary_Diaries). Unfortunately I know little to no Japanese, so I have only read/watched translated versions of these.

Among TV shows, I really enjoyed [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)), [The Queen's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen's_Gambit_(miniseries)) and [Chernobyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)). -->
