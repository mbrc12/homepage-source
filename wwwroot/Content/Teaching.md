I am currently a GSI for [STAT 154/254](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-fall-stat-254-001-lec-001) (Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning), which is being taught by [Nikita Zhivotovskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/nikitazhivotovskiy/). 


In the past I have taught STAT 205A (which is a graduate level probability class), STAT 134 (which is an upper division probability class for undergraduates), and STAT 88 (which is a more introductory variant of STAT 134 combined with some emphasis on statistics).
